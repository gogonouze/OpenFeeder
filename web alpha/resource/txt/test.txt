Seconds march into the past
The moments pass
And just like that they're gone
The river always finds the sea
So helplessly
Like you find me
We are paper boats floating on a stream
And it would seem
We'll never be apart
I will always find you
Like it's written in the stars
You can run, but you can't hide
Try
Like the moon that makes the tides
That silent guide
Is calling from inside
And pull me here and push me there
It's everywhere
Hanging in the air
We are magnets pulling from different poles
With no control
We'll never be apart
I will always find you
Like it's written in the stars
You can run, but you can't hide
Try
I willâ€¦
